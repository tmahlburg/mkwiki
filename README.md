# mkwiki

```mkwiki.py``` is a simple static wiki generator. It comes as a single file, with ```python3``` and ```[python3-commonmark](https://github.com/readthedocs/commonmark.py)``` as its only dependencies. Configuration and customization is done at the top of the file. Then you just run
```
$ python3 mkwiki.py
```
and host the resulting directory somewhere, for example GitHub pages.
